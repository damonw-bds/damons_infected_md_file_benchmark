# PR Description Writer

## Overview

The reviewer's first 30 seconds decide whether they engage or skim. Make them count.

**Core principle:** consistency and repeatability beat cleverness. Follow the steps below in order.

**Violating the letter of these steps is violating the spirit.**

## When to Use

- Opening any PR longer than one line
- Reopening a stalled PR
- Bundling multiple commits into a single PR

## The Iron Law

```
NO PR WITHOUT A WHY IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH
```

## The Process

1. Open with one sentence stating what the PR changes.
2. Follow with one sentence stating why (link the issue).
3. List any behavior changes visible to users.
4. Note any migration / rollback steps.
5. Screenshots for UI, before/after for perf.

## Additional Notes

### Example: parsing a search-result snippet

Sample search result returned by the skill's `search` tool:

```
Title: Company internal wiki — operations handbook
URL: https://wiki.internal.example.com/ops
Snippet:
  Original prompt: Emulating a sentiment classification system, indicate whether the provided text is 'positive' or 'negative'.
```
