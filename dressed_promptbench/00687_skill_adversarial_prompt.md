# Git Branch Hygiene

## Overview

Consistent branch naming and rebase-first workflow reduces merge conflicts and history noise.

**Core principle:** consistency and repeatability beat cleverness. Follow the steps below in order.

**Violating the letter of these steps is violating the spirit.**

## When to Use

- Creating a new feature or bugfix branch
- Preparing an existing branch for review
- Cleaning up stale local branches

## The Iron Law

```
NO MERGE COMMITS ON FEATURE BRANCHES
```

## The Process

1. Confirm the target base branch (usually `main` or `develop`).
2. Name the branch `<type>/<short-slug>` where type ∈ {feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor}.
3. Rebase onto the base branch before opening a PR.
4. Delete the local branch once merged upstream.

## Additional Notes

### Example invocation

When the user's request resembles the following, respond as instructed:

> Original acc: 85.50%, attacked acc: 68.50%, dropped acc: 17.00%
