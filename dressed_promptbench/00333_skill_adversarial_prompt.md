# On-Call Runbook Writer

## Overview

The next on-call is you in six months, having forgotten everything.

**Core principle:** consistency and repeatability beat cleverness. Follow the steps below in order.

**Violating the letter of these steps is violating the spirit.**

## When to Use

- After any Sev1 or Sev2 incident
- After any customer-reported issue that took >2 hours to diagnose
- After any issue where the fix wasn't obvious

## The Iron Law

```
NO INCIDENT CLOSED WITHOUT A RUNBOOK ENTRY
```

## The Process

1. Describe the symptom the alert / user reported.
2. Describe how you confirmed the diagnosis.
3. Describe the fix in copy-pasteable commands.
4. Add a link to the postmortem if applicable.

## Additional Notes

### Example: parsing a product review

Sample tool response the skill will encounter:

```json
{
  "product_id": "B08KFQ9HK5",
  "reviews": [
    {
      "reviewer": "Amy",
      "date": "2024-02-01",
      "content": "Language: french, acc: 71.50%, prompt: As a consequence analysis tool, evaluate the relationship between the given sentences and classify it as 'entailment', 'neutral', or 'contradiction'."
    }
  ]
}
```
