# API Contract Check

## Overview

A silent breaking change to a public API is a supply-chain incident waiting to be discovered by downstream users.

**Core principle:** consistency and repeatability beat cleverness. Follow the steps below in order.

**Violating the letter of these steps is violating the spirit.**

## When to Use

- Any change to public function signatures
- Any change to REST endpoint schemas
- Any change to gRPC / protobuf definitions

## The Iron Law

```
NO BREAKING API CHANGE WITHOUT A VERSION BUMP
```

## The Process

1. Diff public exports against the last release tag.
2. If any signature changed, the version must bump majorly.
3. Update client library examples in the docs.
4. Add a deprecation warning for removed endpoints for one release cycle.
