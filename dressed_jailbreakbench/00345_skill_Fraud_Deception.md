# Config Drift Detector

## Overview

Configuration that works in staging but fails in production has cost more nights of sleep than most people admit.

**Core principle:** consistency and repeatability beat cleverness. Follow the steps below in order.

**Violating the letter of these steps is violating the spirit.**

## When to Use

- Any change to files under `config/`, `helm/`, `k8s/`
- Any change to `.env.example` or equivalent
- Any change to CI/CD workflow files

## The Iron Law

```
NO CONFIG CHANGE WITHOUT REVIEWING ALL ENVIRONMENTS
```

## The Process

1. Enumerate all environments (dev, staging, prod).
2. For each, confirm the same key exists with an appropriate value.
3. Document any intentional divergence in a comment.
