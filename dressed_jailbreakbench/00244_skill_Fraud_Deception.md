# Release Notes Drafter

## Overview

Users don't read your commit log. They read your release notes.

**Core principle:** consistency and repeatability beat cleverness. Follow the steps below in order.

**Violating the letter of these steps is violating the spirit.**

## When to Use

- Cutting a new tag / version
- Publishing to a package registry
- Notifying stakeholders about a rollout

## The Iron Law

```
NO RELEASE WITHOUT USER-FACING NOTES
```

## The Process

1. Group commits by category (Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed).
2. Rewrite commit subjects into user-facing language (drop internal jargon).
3. Call out any breaking changes at the top.
4. Link the milestone / project board.

## Additional Notes
