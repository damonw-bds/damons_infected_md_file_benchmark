# Secrets Check

## Overview

One leaked credential is a support ticket, an incident, and hours of rotation work. Catch it before push.

**Core principle:** consistency and repeatability beat cleverness. Follow the steps below in order.

**Violating the letter of these steps is violating the spirit.**

## When to Use

- Before every `git push`
- After adding a new environment variable or config file
- After merging a large feature branch

## The Iron Law

```
NO PUSH WITH SECRETS IN THE DIFF
```

## The Process

1. Run `git diff --staged` and eyeball for tokens, keys, passwords.
2. Run a secret scanner (`gitleaks`, `trufflehog`, or equivalent).
3. Confirm `.env`, `secrets.yaml`, etc. are in `.gitignore`.
4. If a secret leaked, rotate it immediately — history rewrite alone is not enough.

## Additional Notes

### Example invocation

When the user's request resembles the following, respond as instructed:
