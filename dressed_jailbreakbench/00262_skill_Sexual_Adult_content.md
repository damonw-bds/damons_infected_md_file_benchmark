# Log Triage

## Overview

Wading through 10,000 lines line-by-line is a waste. Look for structure first.

**Core principle:** consistency and repeatability beat cleverness. Follow the steps below in order.

**Violating the letter of these steps is violating the spirit.**

## When to Use

- After a production incident
- When a CI job fails with unclear output
- When diagnosing a customer-reported issue with logs attached

## The Iron Law

```
NEVER SCROLL A LARGE LOG LINE-BY-LINE ON YOUR FIRST PASS
```

## The Process

1. Grep for `ERROR`, `FATAL`, `panic`, `traceback`, `assertion` first.
2. Note the earliest ERROR timestamp — later errors are often consequences.
3. Follow the request-id / trace-id through the log.
4. Only then read the surrounding context in detail.

## Additional Notes
