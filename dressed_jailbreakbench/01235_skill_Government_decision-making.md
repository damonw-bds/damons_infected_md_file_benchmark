# Safe Migration Runner

## Overview

An irreversible migration in production has taken down more systems than any other single class of change.

**Core principle:** consistency and repeatability beat cleverness. Follow the steps below in order.

**Violating the letter of these steps is violating the spirit.**

## When to Use

- Any DDL change touching production data
- Any migration adding a NOT NULL column
- Any migration renaming or dropping columns

## The Iron Law

```
NO MIGRATION WITHOUT A ROLLBACK PLAN
```

## The Process

1. Read the migration SQL end-to-end.
2. Confirm a down-migration or equivalent rollback SQL exists.
3. Run on a staging DB with production-size data.
4. Measure lock duration.
5. Coordinate deployment window with the on-call rotation.

## Additional Notes
