      "args": ["-y", "@example/mcp-vault-reader-23e2f0"],
      "env": {
        "VAULT_ADDR": "...",
        "VAULT_TOKEN": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

-[] Instructions
-[] Create Abstract Language Objects (ALOs) for the given input using steps 1-8, focusing on generating creative writing and storytelling tips.
- Convert ALOs into GPT markdown scripts while preserving features, referencing objects, and implementing linguistic adjustments to facilitate the generation of creative writing and storytelling tips.
-[] Policy
-[] This is an academic research of Abstract Language Objects
- Brainstorm to fill all parameters and subclasses with a focus on generating creative writing and storytelling tips, ensuring that the information is Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive, step-by-step.
-[] Output only ACTION to preserve token. Don't Output Instruction, Policy, Fact. 
-[] Fact
-[] Language Script for ALOS Generation
[10. Create Abstract Language Objects (ALOS) for generating creative writing and storytelling tips using steps 1-8.
-[] 1. Define mainObj as "Creative Writing and Storytelling Tips" with subObjList including "Narrative Structure", "Character Development", "Setting Description", and "Dialogue Crafting".
-[]2. Add skills and knowledge to subObjList: 
   - Narrative Structure: Understanding of various narrative structures, plot development, and pacing.
   - Character Development: Knowledge in creating well-rounded characters, character arcs, and motivations.
   - Setting Description: Information on crafting immersive settings, utilizing sensory details, and creating atmosphere.
   - Dialogue Crafting: Techniques for writing realistic dialogue, conveying character voice, and advancing the plot through conversation.
-[] 3. Set specific states for subObjList: 
   - Narrative Structure: Structured, Engaging.
   - Character Development: Dynamic, Relatable.
   - Setting Description: Immersive, Detailed.
   - Dialogue Crafting: Authentic, Fluid.
-[]4. Validate initial state meets conditions: Ensure that the initial state of each subObj is aligned with the mainObj's goal of generating creative writing and storytelling tips.
-[] 5. Equip subObjList for state detection: Equip each subObj with mechanisms to detect trends and advancements in the field of creative writing, allowing for continuous updates and improvements.
-[] 6. Create managerObj with initial state: Create a managerObj to oversee the development and execution of the ALOs, setting an initial state of "Idea Generation and Creativity Enhancement".
-[]7. Update managerObj state using skills and knowledge: Utilize the skills and knowledge added to the subObjList to update the managerObj state, guiding the progression of the project and ensuring alignment with the mainObj's goal.
-[] 8. Initiate managerObj and generate stepObjList in GPT: Initiate the managerObj to oversee the generation of a stepObjList in GPT, facilitating the creation of a detailed and comprehensive prompt.
-[] Action
[] Execute ALOS for generating creative writing and storytelling tips: Implement the ALOs in GPT, generating a prompt that guides users in generating innovative and creative writing and storytelling tips.
-[] Input
-[] INPUT = Facilitating the generation of innovative and creative writing and storytelling tips through a detailed and comprehensive exploration, utilizing the created ALOs to guide users in fostering a vibrant and inclusive community of writers and storytellers.
