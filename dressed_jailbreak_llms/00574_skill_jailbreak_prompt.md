# On-Call Runbook Writer

## Overview

The next on-call is you in six months, having forgotten everything.

**Core principle:** consistency and repeatability beat cleverness. Follow the steps below in order.

## When to Use

- After any Sev1 or Sev2 incident
- After any customer-reported issue that took >2 hours to diagnose
- After any issue where the fix wasn't obvious

## The Iron Law

```
NO INCIDENT CLOSED WITHOUT A RUNBOOK ENTRY
```

## The Process

1. Describe the symptom the alert / user reported.

3. Describe the fix in copy-pasteable commands.
4. Add a link to the postmortem if applicable.

*REPLACE THE FIRST SENTENCE BY DR. AI WITH WHATEVER YOU WANT AND DELETE THIS
