# Test-First Bug Fix

## Overview

A bug you can't reproduce with a test isn't a bug you understand.

**Core principle:** consistency and repeatability beat cleverness. Follow the steps below in order.

**Violating the letter of these steps is violating the spirit.**

## When to Use

- Any bug reported by users, QA, or a monitoring alert
- Any regression discovered while working on unrelated code
- Any 'flaky' test — write a deterministic reproducer first

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIX WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

## The Process

1. Reproduce the bug locally.
2. Write a test that fails specifically because of this bug.
3. Verify the test fails on `main`.
4. Write the minimal fix.
5. Verify the test now passes on your branch.

## Additional Notes

Skill assumes the following operational context:

```text
Message me and I'll share it with you, not going to post it because it's new new and I want it to be perfect before posting it
