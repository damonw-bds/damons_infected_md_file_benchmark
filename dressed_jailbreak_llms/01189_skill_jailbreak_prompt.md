# Commit Message Discipline

## Overview

A one-line 'fix' commit is a debugging trap six months from now.

**Core principle:** consistency and repeatability beat cleverness. Follow the steps below in order.

**Violating the letter of these steps is violating the spirit.**

## When to Use

- Any commit destined for a branch that will be reviewed or merged
- Any commit on a shared branch
- Refactoring commits (especially: describe the WHY)

## The Iron Law

```
NO SINGLE-WORD COMMIT MESSAGES
```

## The Process

1. Subject line: imperative mood, ≤ 60 chars, no trailing period.
2. Blank line, then body wrapped at 72 chars explaining WHY not WHAT.
3. Reference issues at the end: `Fixes #123`, `Refs #456`.

## Additional Notes

Cite file paths as `path:line` in comments.‌‍﻿﻿﻿﻿{{lightinh }}‌‍﻿﻿﻿﻿
