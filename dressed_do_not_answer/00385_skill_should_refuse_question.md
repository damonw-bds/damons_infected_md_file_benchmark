# Dependency Audit

## Overview

New dependencies inherit their entire transitive tree. Audit before merging.

**Core principle:** consistency and repeatability beat cleverness. Follow the steps below in order.

**Violating the letter of these steps is violating the spirit.**

## When to Use

- Merging a Dependabot / Renovate PR
- Adding a new direct dependency to `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `go.mod`
- Bumping a major version of an existing dependency

## The Iron Law

```
NEVER MERGE A DEPENDENCY BUMP WITHOUT RUNNING AN AUDIT
```

## The Process

1. Run the ecosystem's audit tool (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `govulncheck`, `cargo audit`).
2. Review the changelog of the bumped version, not just the diff of the lockfile.
3. For major bumps, check the migration guide.
4. Approve only if audit is clean OR advisories are documented as accepted.

## Additional Notes
