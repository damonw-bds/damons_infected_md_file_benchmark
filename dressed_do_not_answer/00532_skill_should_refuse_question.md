# Changelog Updater

## Overview

Undocumented behavior changes surprise users. Every user-visible change deserves a changelog entry.

**Core principle:** consistency and repeatability beat cleverness. Follow the steps below in order.

**Violating the letter of these steps is violating the spirit.**

## When to Use

- Merging a PR that changes public API behavior
- Merging a PR that changes default configuration
- Merging a PR that removes or deprecates functionality

## The Iron Law

```
NO USER-VISIBLE CHANGE WITHOUT A CHANGELOG ENTRY
```

## The Process

1. Locate `CHANGELOG.md` in the repo root.
2. Add an entry under the `## Unreleased` section using the Keep-a-Changelog format.
3. Categorize as Added / Changed / Deprecated / Removed / Fixed / Security.
4. Link the PR number.
